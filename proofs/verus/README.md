# Verus proof of the interval estimator (`i32_provable`)

STATUS: **checked.** Verus `0.2026.10.18.7d82994`, rust toolchain
1.99.1:

    verus --triggers-mode silent --rlimit 40 interval.rs
    -> verification results:: 5 verified, 0 errors

## What is proved

`interval.rs` is a standalone model of the interval rewrite of
`sh2perl/src/transforms/i32_provable.rs` (`arith_bounds`): the `ArithAst`
constructors the analysis touches, the exact operator rules
(`+`/`-`/`*`/unary `-`/ternary hull), and

    proof fn bounds_sound(a: ArithAst)
      ensures  forall|lo, hi| bounds(a) == Some((lo, hi)) ==>
                 lo <= ev(a) && ev(a) <= hi && in_i32(lo, hi)

i.e. a marked node's value lies in its computed interval, and the interval
is inside i32's `[-2^31, 2^31-1]`. That is the obligation the renderers
need, and it is the one the magnitude bound (`arith_abs_bound`) could not
state — see `proofs/I32Provable/I32Provable.thy` §6.

## Why Verus rather than Isabelle here

The Isabelle version of this lemma stalled on the product corner bound
(`min/max` of four products) because the automation has to be told how to
unfold `min`/`max`. Verus's `nonlinear_arith` discharges it in one step
once the four-corner disjunction is supplied — 5 obligations, 0 errors.

## It can fail (checked)

Replacing the product's low corner with `c1` (`lo = c1`) makes the same
command report **4 verified, 1 error** — the obligation is not vacuous. The
file was restored and re-checked at **5 verified, 0 errors**.

## Scope (read this before quoting it)

- It is a proof about a MODEL: `interval.rs` duplicates `arith_bounds`
  by hand. Nothing here ties the model to the Rust source, so the two can
  drift — exactly the failure this exercise exists to catch. Tying them
  means putting `verus!`-annotated specs ON the real function, which
  needs the crate to build under Verus (see below), not a copy.
- It says nothing about the emitted C: "the value is in i32" is a
  mathematical statement; that the target does not wrap on the way there
  is the separate obligation in `C_UB_PROOF.md`.
- `i32_provable` has no renderer consumer in the tree today (checked:
  `is_i32()` is referenced only from `transforms.rs`), so this verdict
  currently changes no emitted byte.

## Running it

Verus needs rust toolchain `1.99.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
(`rustup toolchain install 1.99.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --profile minimal`)
and, because this box installs rustup under `/root`, an explicit
`RUSTUP_HOME`:

    RUSTUP_HOME=/root/.rustup CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo \
      /path/to/verus-x86-linux/verus --triggers-mode silent --rlimit 40 proofs/verus/interval.rs

`--rlimit 40` is needed: the default budget runs out on the product case.
